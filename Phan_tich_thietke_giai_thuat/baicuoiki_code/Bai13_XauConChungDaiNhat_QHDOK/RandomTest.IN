Vietnam said Thursday that Taiwan’s live fire drills in waters off Truong Sa (Spratly) Islands are a violation of Vietnam’s sovereignty and should not be repeated. The fact that Taiwan performs live fire drills in sea areas around Truong Sa Archipelago’s Ba Binh (Itu Aba) Island is a serious violation of Vietnam’s territorial sovereignty, threatening peace, stability, safety and maritime security by escalating and complicating the East Sea situation, said foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang. East Sea is how Vietnam calls the South China Sea. She was speaking at a press meet, responding to inquiries about the fire drills by Taiwanese defense forces on the Itu Aba Island on November 24. Hang said Vietnam resolutely opposes the violations and asks Taiwan not to perform the illegal drills or repeat such violations in the future. Vietnam has full legal basis and historical evidence to assert its sovereignty over the Hoang Sa (Paracel) and Truong Sa (Spratly) islands in accordance with international law, she said. Taiwan illegally occupies the Ba Binh Island, which is the largest natural area on the Spratly Archipelago.
The list of top Vietnamese artists also included Son Tung MTP, Bich Phuong and Hoang Thuy Linh, whose recent album, "Hoang," has become a hit. Chillies’s "Mascara," Den Vau’s "Loi Nho" (Small Alley) and Phuong’s "Em Da Bo Hut Thuoc Chua?" (Have You Given Up Smoking?) were joined in the list of five most streamed songs by "How You Like That" by Blackpink and "Dynamite" by BTS. The rise of rap music in Vietnam has raised the profile of local rappers. BinZ, for instance, has entered the list, becoming one of the most streamed male artists along with American singers Justin Bieber and Lauv. BTS, also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a seven-member South Korean boy band that debuted in 2013. In 2018 they became the fastest group since the Beatles to earn four U.S. number one albums, doing so in less than two years. Blackpink is a four-member girl band, whose music video is currently the most viewed for any Korean group on YouTube. They are also the most followed girl group on Spotify. The streaming service, which came to Vietnam in 2018, is currently available in 92 markets. It has around 286 million active users.
